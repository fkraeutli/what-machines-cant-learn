# Intelligence and Cognition

???

before we start with Artificial Intelligence, a brief look at predominant theories of mind at the time AI was invented

---

## Hat Tip

For this lecture I heavily draw on what I learnt in the seminars of [Prof. Mark Bishop](https://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/staff/m-bishop/) during the Cognitive Computing MSc at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The information compiled here stems from the slides which are still available on the [course website](http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas02mb/Cognitive%20Computing/) (unfortunately the course no longer exists).

## Questions
- What is intelligence?
- How does the mind work?

---

## Brief history of theories of mind

- Mind explained by dominant technology at the time
	- hydraulic engine
	- mechanical engine
	- computer
- Theories of mind developed since the 1950s often equate minds with computers
    - brain like a computer, brain processes information

## Theory of mind in Artificial Intelligence

### Representational theory of mind

???

- mind uses representations of the world
- mind does not act directly on the world

--

#### alternatives:

--

- direct realism
- embodied theories of mind
- ...

---

## Dualism

- Substance dualism (Descartes)
- Property dualism

???

- mental vs physical
- Substance dualism 
    - mental and physical are ontologically distinct
    - two categories of being: mind stuff and body stuff
- Property dualism
    - mental and physical comprise two distinct classes of properties instantiated in the same object (e.g. brain)
---

## Dualism

### Substance dualism

- res cogitans
    - immaterial substance without spatial dimension whose essence is to think
- res extensa
    - physical substance with extension and location inspect

---

## Dualism

Therefore:
- perceiving subject is separate from perceived object
- perception is indirect
- brain sends signals to mind which invokes mental items
- mental items can invoke brain states which translate to motor events

???

- perceiving subject is ontologically distinct (and separate) from perceived object
- perception is indirect: mind accesses representation of things not the thing itself
- brain (res extensa) sends signals to mind (res cogitans) which invokes mental items used in perception and cognition
- conversely, mental items can invoke brain states which translate to motor events
  
- Dualism is therefore a representational theory of mind
- in representational theories of mind cognitive states are relations to mental representations which have content
- ‘Cognitive processes’ are mental operations on mental representations      
---

## Dualism

Arguments for Dualism: argument from skeptical doubts
- Cogito, ergo sum
- I can doubt that sth exists
- But I cannot doubt that I exist (I cannot doubt that I am doubting)
- It is possible that 'I' could exist and the 'material human being I' not exist

## Dualism

### Implications for Artificial Intelligence

Belief in Dualism and representational theory of mind essential for belief in Strong AI

???

- Strong Artificial Intelligence is only possible of intelligence does not rely on the physical
- and hence can be implemented on a computer
- (caveat: there are a ton of other theories of mind with different implications on AI, but too much to cover here)

---
## Functionalism

???

- Another requirement for Artificial Intelligence
	- we need to make 'mind' independent of 'brain' substance
	- we have separated mind from substance, but we also want to replace the substance so that we can instantiate a mind in a computer

---

## Functionalism

### Supervenience

X supervenes on Y when:

- X is determined by Y
- but X is not fully reducible to Y

???

A group of properties X supervenes on a group of properties Y, exactly when the X-group properties are determined by the Y-group properties but X-group properties are not fully reducible to Y-group properties.

Supervenience is a kind of dependency relationship, typically held to obtain between sets of properties. 

Supervenience has traditionally been used to describe relationships between sets of properties in a manner which does not imply a strong reductive relationship.
E.g. Economics supervenes on physical properties of the world; two identical worlds will instantiate the same economic properties but this does not imply that economics is reducible to physics in any straightforward way.

A group of properties X supervenes on a group of properties Y, exactly when the X-group properties are determined by the Y-group properties but X-group properties are not fully reducible to Y-group properties.

Property (X), supervenes on a property (Y), iff there could not be a difference in property (X) without a difference in property (Y).

## Functionalism

### Supervenience

#### Example:

Relations between acceleration, velocity, position of an object in space

Acceleration supervenes on velocity but is not the same as velocity

???

An object cannot change its acceleration without changing its velocity, and in turn, cannot change its velocity without changing its position.
An important feature of supervenience illustrated by this example is that the supervening properties need not be identical to the properties upon which they supervene.
Thus, acceleration supervenes on velocity, but is not the same thing as velocity.

---

## Functionalism

### Supervenience

Supervening properties need not be identical to subvening properties

--

'Thinking' can be a supervenient property of the brain

--

But thinking is not dependent on the brain

--

=> **Thinking can in principle be implemented on a computer**

# Functional theories of mind

- Every mental state is a functional state of the system
- If mental properties are functional properties, then mental properties must supervene on the physical.
- If functional properties supervene on the physical, they are not dependent on the physical
- Allows for _multiple realisability_

???

Functionalism entails that every type of mental state, event or process, is simply a functional type of state, event or process of the system.
Functionalism about cognition, concerns functionalism about cognitive states (such as beliefs, desires etc).
Functionalism about consciousness, concerns the phenomenal experience of such states (the subjective feel of pain etc).
But if mental properties are functional properties, then mental properties must also supervene on the physical.
As the functional properties supervene on the physical.
Multiple realisability:
realise mind on computer, on silicone based Martians, etc.

Can a mind be implemented by a computer?

--

If not, why not?

--

What are some alternative theories of mind?

???
