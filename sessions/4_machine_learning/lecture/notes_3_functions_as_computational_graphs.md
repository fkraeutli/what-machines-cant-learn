## Representing Functions as Computational Graphs

We will now represent a linear function as a computational graph. This will give us a graphical representation of a step by step instruction to compute the function.

We expand the operands..

...and represent them as nodes in the order of operation: first multiplication and then addition.

We also plug in the variables `a`, `b` and `x` as nodes connected to the respective operands.

Let's calculate with the graph by plugging in some numbers.

Values of 2 for `x` and 3 for `a`...

...gives us 6 at the multiplication node.

We add 4 for `b`...

...and get 10 at the addition node, which delivers the output.
