### Linear Functions


A linear function can be plotted as a straight line with respect to a X and Y axis

Linear functions have the form `y = ax + b`. `a` as a multiplier of 'x' determines how steep the line is. `b` adds a vertical offset. We use `y` and `f(x)` interchangeably.

Let's fill in some numbers. For example `2` for `a` and `1` for `b`. We can calculate the values for `f(x)` for arbitrary values of `x`

...and drawing a line through them gives us a plot of the linear function.
