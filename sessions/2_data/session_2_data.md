# Session 2: Data

## Lecture

> Slides: [Data](lecture/slides_data.md)

The lecture begins with a working definition of data, emphasising that data is not neutral and given, but something that has been collected. [Johanna Drucker's](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html) concept of 'capta' is used to illustrate this. Recent work by [Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein](https://bookbook.pubpub.org/pub/zrlj0jqb), and [Mimi Onuoha](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets) underline how the data that is being captured and – crucially – data that is not being recorded reflects structural racism and mysoginy. A brief history of data covers cuneiform tablets and punch cards. Early innovations in big data processing, relying on the idea of data records as well as women's labour, are discussed through research by [Christine von Oertzen](https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/users/coertzen).

The lecture then continues to look at data on the web: how data is being transmitted, where it is captured and stored. This second part contains six hands-on exercises that are outline below.
