- Antikythera mechanism
- regarded as one of the earliest computers
- device believed to be used to calculate the movements of the planets
	"The device could predict astronomical positions, eclipses, the motions of the sun, the moon and probably some of the planets." (Wikipedia)

???

- In 1822 the English mathematician Charles Babbage proposed a steam driven calculating machine the size of a room, which he called the Difference Engine.
- This machine would be able to compute tables of numbers, such as logarithm tables.

???

- recognised potential of machine as multi-purpose calculation tool
- wrote first programme for machine (although machine was never built during her lifetime)
- first computer programmer

- However most computers around the time not machines, but human, and mostly women
- [France, wig makers rendered job-less by fall of aristocracy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/computing-power-used-to-be-measured-in-kilo-girls/280633/)

???

- Eniac (1945) first programmable general purpose computer, vacuum tubes
- programming = patching cables

???
- 1960s mainframe computing (one central computer, terminals)
- e.g. IBM 360

- personal computer
- here Macintosh 1984

### A Universal Machine

???
- transition to programmable computer = universal machines
- what we now regard as a computer, a universal machine. something that can compute different things
